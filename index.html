					My name is Adam Heimowitz and I am a senior at Binghamton University majoring in Computer Science. Ever since I was a child I have enjoyed experimenting with computers as I just found them to be so fascinating. My adventures with computers started when I was young, I used to break my computer on purpose so that I could try to fix it, but unfortunately in the beginning I was never able to fix it on my own. After a few times that this happened I was eventually able to fix it by myself, this is when I sought to do more so I created my first website, PcProbs.org. My idea for this website was a simple website where people could post computer issues and I would help them fix the issues. This was a good start for me until I got to high school and started taking classes on java. So when it became time to go to college and pick a major computer science was an easy choice.

					Throughout my time at college I have learned a lot about programming not only through the various classes that I have taken in my time here but also through the internships I have had the privledge of holding. After my sophmore year I acquired an IT internship with the Trust Company of the West in New York City. This internship gave me expereince in the real world fixing computers, setting up servers and solving network issues. Then the following year I worked for TD Ameritrade in Jersey City where I gained real world programming experience. This internship gave me the opportunity to work hands on on a web interface that would be actually be used by some of the employees. Getting to work on a project that would be used by people was a great experience for me and I hope in the future to continue working on projects that will be used by and enhance the lives of a wide variety of people.
